# webdev-prac

This is your first task in the team for PPOC WebDev. This task will increase your HTML and CSS skills to a basic level, and also strengthen your design skills, your time management and your teamwork skills, alongside helping you learn project management and workflow management. 

The task basically would be to just emulate an YouTube video, whose link I have provided, but as a team. The website has 5 pages, and they have been allotted accordingly to all the team members.

I have created the master repository for the project. It can be found here. https://github.com/IonUdvas/webdev-prac 

You have to fork the repo, then make the appropriate changes to the website, and then submit a pull request, after which, I will merge the changes that you make to the website. 

Since mostly you are new to Git, you might start learning from some online resources, like basic workflow of a github repo, but nevertheless, we will have a session on 18.06.2022, where we will sort out basic Git and working with SCSS. 

The deadline for this project is 26th June, 2022, so the faster you start the better. 

It will be better if you report all the issues you have in the combined WhatsApp grp, PPOC Web, so that we can this collaborative attempt successful.

Also, you can customize the text in any way you like.

Happy Coding
